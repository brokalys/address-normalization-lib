# Address Normalization lib

Minimalistic JS library for normalizing addresses across the Brokalys platform. Used for quick & easy building lookup.

```
yarn add @brokalys/address-normalization
```

```
import normalizeAddress from '@brokalys/address-normalization';

normalizeAddress({
  // ..the data
  location_district: 'RÄ«ga',
});
```
